# Prediction-of-London-Bike-sharing-based-using-Machine-Learning and Pyspark



Project Title:  Prediction of London Bike sharing based on Past data

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset. The dataset has 10 columns and 5000 rows which is suitable for big-data analysis
Problem Statement: With the cost-of-living increasing day by day, and congestion charges levied in many parts of London, the choice of using public transport makes sense to people. But what if you want to travel shorter distances, still have your independence, and maintain a healthy lifestyle – that’s where bike sharing started (is my assumption). Many organizations like Santander offer public bike-sharing schemes with several docking stations across London to help and encourage this lifestyle. However, it is also a challenge to maintain the requisite number of bikes. The goal of this project is to try and predict the bike share numbers using Machine Learning


Aim & Objectives:
The aim of this project is to try to predict future bike shares in London based on past information on bike sharing in London. 
To identify the best prediction model for the data collected
Analysis of the previous data and visualize the hidden patterns using Python and Tableau
Check the suitable machine learning classification type (Classification or Regression)
Compare the models generated and evaluate the prediction performance

Tools & Techniques:
Python
Py-spark
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Machine Learning models
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
